	Our privacy policy is simple and does not require a lawyer 
	to understand it.  
	We will pounce on the opportunity to sell every
	bit of information on you we have at our disposal in order 
	to boost our bottom line.  We will gladly sell your 
	address, phone, email, age, name of pet, name of
	favorite superhero, color of bunny slippers you wear at 
	home, and the like, to any willing buyer who will pay us the big bucks.  
	(BTW, we <em>know</em> you wear bunny slippers at home and   
	we know what color they are.  You really have no secrets 
	from us.)  If you have sensitive information that you don't want us to 
	share with the world, then keep it to yourself -- don't tell us.  
	<br><br>
	It's really that simple.
